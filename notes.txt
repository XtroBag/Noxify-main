AutoMod System:
Fix so all collectors so it will block others trying to click the command senders menus.
Fix errors happening when users might delete any of the prompts/menus during running.
Fix the embeds to be more fancy with maybe some logging data features and more.
Create the database setup for the automod rules and the event idea to delete it from the database once it was created.
